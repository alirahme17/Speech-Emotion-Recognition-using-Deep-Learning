# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
A hybrid Deep Learning framework for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). This project fuses CNNs for feature extraction, LSTMs for temporal modeling, and Attention mechanisms to classify emotions from raw audio. It utilizes RAVDESS, SAVEE, and CREMA-D datasets with data augmentation to achieve robust, speaker-independent prediction.
